The government has access to the most up to date, and accurate, information to make a graph. This dataset was also selected because it has data up until the end of March. We needed data that was in line with the COVID-19, so finding unemployment data that was updating was very important. Covid-19 is relatively new, so some datasets we found online were not updated recently enough to show any potential impacts that the coronavirus has on unemployment. \n"

        "Conclusion: The coronavirus outbreak is a very unique situation not only for the United States but the entire world. Over roughly 2 months the unemployment numbers have reached a staggering 6.5 million for the United States which is an all time high and it has never been more in entire history. After looking at the data given on the graphics above it can be seen after analysis that as time moved on and as the coronavirus got worse and worse it impacted unemployment even more. There are many external factors that have impacted the coronavirus which has then in turn had a great impact on employment numbers. The coronavirus has shut down businesses in nearly every state which has resulted in a major economic destruction with next to no Americans being left with a job. It is believed the actual job losses are thus far much worse than the numbers being reported and it is widely believed that the job loss will continue to decrease. The Federal Reserve tried to break that pattern on Thursday with an ambitious plan to help companies and state and local governments get more access to funding. \n",
        "The Fed said its new and expanded programs could print an extra 2.3 trillion into the economy. The central bank’s intervention was welcomed in financial markets, with the S&P 500 stock index ending the day with a gain of almost 1.5 percent. Additional help from Washington hit a Senate roadblock over what to include and was a usual battle of sides left versus right. Republicans have proposed 250 billion to a loan program for distressed small businesses, while Democrats want $250 billion more to assist hospitals and state and local governments dealing with coronavirus related expenses. What it will take to stabilize the economy is no more than guesswork, many analysts say. The purposeful and sudden halt in economic activity has no future, and no one knows when the restrictions on movement and commerce enacted to slow infections will be lifted\n",
        ". Each state has gotten some aid to help with outrageous unemployment numbers from federal loans. Hugely populous states including New York, California, and Illinois enacted “stay at home” measures last month that required many nonessential businesses to close and residents to limit their public interactions. But Florida, home to 21 million residents and the third-most populated state in the country, did not enact its own stay at home orders until April 3, an action that might have come too late to prevent a large outbreak. A number of other states, including Texas and South Carolina, have yet to close many businesses or mandate that people stay home. Numerous models suggest these actions are the key to lessening the stress on hospitals and flattening the curve. All in all, after taking in all the considerations and affects the coronavirus has had on the United States the effect that it has had on unemployment is definitely where it hit the hardest. For a better visualization on unemployment versus coronavirus you can look at the graph(s) above and see the easy visualization and comparison of which its information has been gathered from 2 very reputable sources."
